Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) forecasts to Folsom Lake (i.e., ensemble inflow forecasts), are downloaded from the California-Nevada River Forecast Center (CNRFC) with the Hydrologic Ensemble Forecast Service (HEFS) model. Daily ESP forecasts used in this study are aggregated from hourly ensemble data that accounts for regulation effects. ESP forecasts are available from June 2013 to now, with the number of ensemble members varying over time (from 39 to 69 members). Each ensemble member represents a specific water year to provide hydrologic forcings to generate a streamflow forecast. 

for n-day total inflow folders, all units are TAF (thousand acre-feet) --

"Fol_Box_Cox_flood_total_before/after19": Box-Cox transformed n-day total predicted inflow volume in TAF, only including flood season (November 18- Feburary 28/29). Note, fitted lambda(s) are different for each forecast lead time, which are obtained based on observed n-day total inflow [see "fitted_lambda_flood_total.csv"]
